This is my attempt at learning some 3D graphics basics,
using OpenGL. Please, be free to judge me for my ambition
of actually creating an engine. (I know that's not gonna happen)

The 33 stands for the 3 dimensions in which the 3-sided polygons ("triangles" for those with an advanced vocabulary range) reside.

Wish me luck, I'm gonna be using https://www.opengl-tutorial.org 's beginner tuto.
